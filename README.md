# GetDrivingDistance
Script designed to take a csv of addresses, convert them to work with the open street map API, and then calculate a sum of the driving distance between a set starting point and each of the addresses.

Specifically used to extract an appointments list from Square, filtered by date and whether appointments were confirmed or cancelled, then run over using this to determine driving distance done for small business.

This script is nice and short
